###  Function created to reutilize HTTP Status
There is a function "createResSpec" who is being used to send the status code through all the methods of the API. This function enable me for passing parameters to check the status code are equal the API response.

### Check the user name and surname: 
The first test is for check if the user 2 has the first name "Janet" and the last name is "Weaver".

### Check an inexistent user:
This test case is being used to guarantee if the API isn't showing an invalid value when the user doesn't exists.

### Send a valid email username and password
This test case is used to send the email and password and to return the id and token for the user.

### Update values for the client
This test case is used to update the values of name and job for the user 2. The expected result is bring the name "morpheus" and job "zion resident"
